# JenkinsAzure
Creating VMs in Azure for a Jenkins server which deploys a Python server via a build slave

In Azure, pull the repo and run the VMsetup.sh file with the command ./VMsetup.sh
This will take a while to set up

Once this is complete, install Jenkins on the JenkinsVM
and java in the Jenkins build slave VM
